Exercises on GitHub

Be sure to study the exercises we do in class and edit/play with them to understand how C++ works. The first time, you need to clone the repo, as I explained in class:

git clone https://github.com/pcc-cs/cs-003a-spring-2021-exercises (Links to an external site.) Exercises
This will create a local repo on your computer under the folder Exercises (you can name it anything, but I recommend names that correspond to the repo name). You only need to clone once. To pick up subsequent changes from classes, you need to pull from the repo. Go "inside" the Exercises folder (using the cd command) and pull:

git pull origin master
